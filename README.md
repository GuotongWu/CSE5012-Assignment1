## Project for Assignment 1 (Single Objective Bound Constrained Numerical Optimization)
**Programming language: Matlab**

**Project**
* The folder named ***benchmark*** contains the benchmark functions to be optimised. You shouldn't edit it.
* The Matlab file named ***configurations.m*** determines the functions to be tested and optimisation budget. You shouldn't edit it.
* The folder named ***utils*** contains some useful functions (sampling from certain distribution, etc.).
* After each optimisation run, your solution will be automatic stored in the folder ***result***. 
* The folder named ***res*** contains temporary files. You shouldn't edit it.
* The Matlab file named ***testEA.m*** is used to test your EA. You shouldn't edit it. We will use this file to test your program when marking your assignment.
* The folder named ***optimisers*** contains your ***EA***. 
* The Matlab file named ***EA.m*** inside ***optimisers*** is where you should implement your EA, including different operators, and fitness function. Normally, this is the only file that you need to work on.

**Evaluation of program**
* The submitted ***EA.m***  will be tested. 
* The format, naming and readability take 2 marks each.
* Any program that is failed to run receives 0 mark.

**Remark:** 
* You are not encouraged to add new files or folders. ***EA.m*** is the only file that you will submit. Feel free to define multiple functions inside the ***EA.m*** file.


## Prohibition
You will get 0 as mark for this assignment if any of the following cases happens:
* You use other programming languages.
* You don't respect the naming policy of files.
* The report/program/presentation submission is delayed for 3 days (72 hours) or more.
* Plagiarism.
